18/01/26, 07:42 PM - Harry Potter: I think the hat listened more than it spoke. It didn’t ask what we wanted to be good at. It asked what we’d stand up for when it hurts.
18/01/26, 07:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: Standing up is pointless if you don’t end up on top. The world respects results, not intentions.
18/01/26, 07:44 PM - Ron Weasley: Funny how your “results” never include anyone else benefiting. Some of us actually care who’s beside us when things go wrong.
18/01/26, 07:45 PM - Hermione Granger: Caring isn’t enough if you don’t think. Doing the right thing means understanding consequences, patterns, and truth — not just charging ahead.
18/01/26, 07:46 PM - Luna Lovegood: I have been studying all day i know that Truth doesn’t always look sensible at first. People ignore things they don’t understand. That doesn’t make those things less real.
18/01/26, 07:47 PM - Cedric Diggory: And not everything important needs to be dramatic. Showing up every day, doing your part, treating people fairly — that’s how trust is built. Its important to care for people.
18/01/26, 07:48 PM - Draco Malfoy: Trust doesn’t protect you when power shifts. Planning does. Control does. Depending on others is a weakness.
18/01/26, 07:49 PM - Harry Potter: Depending on others is how you survive. I’ve seen what happens when someone thinks they can do everything alone. A good leader stands beside goodness.
18/01/26, 07:50 PM - Ron Weasley: Yeah, and it usually ends with them wondering why no one’s left.
18/01/26, 07:51 PM - Hermione Granger: Ambition without limits becomes dangerous. Intelligence without humility becomes cruel. Every strength turns into a flaw if you let ego lead.
18/01/26, 07:52 PM - Luna Lovegood: If we think about facts. Balance is rare. That’s why it matters. The clever, the brave, the patient, the driven — none of them work alone.
18/01/26, 07:53 PM - Cedric Diggory: Some people chase recognition. Others just make sure the job gets done. History forgets names, but it remembers outcomes.
18/01/26, 07:54 PM - Draco Malfoy: You all talk like wanting more is a sin. I want influence. I want control over my future. There’s nothing wrong with that.
18/01/26, 07:55 PM - Harry Potter: Wanting more isn’t the problem. But supporting evil is.
18/01/26, 07:56 PM - Ron Weasley: Exactly. Winning means nothing if you lose yourself getting there.
18/01/26, 07:57 PM - Hermione Granger: In the end, what defines us isn’t talent or background. It’s the decisions we make when no one’s forcing us.
18/01/26, 07:58 PM - Luna Lovegood: The hat probably knew that. It saw what we’d choose, not what we claimed to be. Knowledge matters more to us than winning or showing off.
18/01/26, 07:59 PM - Cedric Diggory: Different paths. Same test. What matters is who you are when it counts.
18/01/26, 08:00 PM - Draco Malfoy: …Maybe. Or maybe it just knew we’d argue about this forever.
18/01/26, 08:01 PM - Harry Potter: “Sometimes doing the right thing is more important than thinking about the risk.”
